####SHORT TIME####
- Fix the Register Bank issue
- Make a Register Bank Testbench
- Include Memory
- Make the control Module (NOW only for counting the PC and other small staff)
- Connect all the modules in order to have a no-pipelined processor
- Look for a program to convert from C to Assembler, use it with the testbenchs and personal programs, and fill the memory with these assembler instructions (look for which positions the code (instructions) has to be placed)

####LONG TIME####
- Pipeline the stages
- Control the data, structural and control flow hazards
- Include Data Cache
- Include Instructions Cache
- Separate the MULT operation from the ALU in another module (and DIV?)
- Be happy
